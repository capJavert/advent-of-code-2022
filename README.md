# Advent of Code 2022

### Some notes from the previous year:
* find better way of visualizing puzzles based in the 3D space
* use pen and paper more
* think about ranges and constraints for specific inputs for optimizing runtimes

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: First AoC weekend done, got the grasp with wasm and ready for more! Also, this idea of parsing data with JavaScript and then running typed dataset in rust for performance seems to work good so far ðŸ‘Œ
### Update #3: Ditched Rust for today... just look at this example of implementing cyclic tree data structure in Rust https://applied-math-coding.medium.com/a-tree-structure-implemented-in-rust-8344783abd75 ... I wonder if there is a better way.. or crate.
### Update #4: Today was hard for some reason. I think the main issue was that my initial "part 1" logic could not be applied to "part 2" because I implemented specific constraints that were not true for "part 2". Finally I solved it with minimal changes after re-reviewing constraints in the puzzle text. Lesson here is to avoid introducing any kind of artifical constraints, and if I need to introduce them then I need to re-review them when starting "part 2".
### Update #5: Today (day 10) lesson is: "don't overthink it" - solve the task, worry about other use cases on later days.
### Update #6: Day 11 Part 2 was requiring #math hacks.. [smarter people](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zifqmh/2022_day_11_solutions/) explain it better than me.
