# Advent of Code 2022

### Some notes from the previous year:
* find better way of visualizing puzzles based in the 3D space
* use pen and paper more
* think about ranges and constraints for specific inputs for optimizing runtimes

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: First AoC weekend done, got the grasp with wasm and ready for more! Also, this idea of parsing data with JavaScript and then running typed dataset in rust for performance seems to work good so far ðŸ‘Œ
